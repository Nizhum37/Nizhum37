My research interest broadly lies in Applied Mathematics focuses on modelling intracellular problems. My research involves travelling waves,  numerical analysis, mathematical biology, biological invasion, mathematical modelling and stochastic simulation. I like to work on different mathematical modelling projects in bio-mathematics, cancer biology, mathematical oncology, cell biology, infectious disease dynamics and other relevant fields.
